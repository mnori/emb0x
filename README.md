This is a project where the goal is to build a simple, customisable web based jukebox app. We want something that can be run on a very cheap Amazon set up. Additionally it ought to be easy for someone to get their own node working without needing to know much about the tech details, i.e. I'd like something with an automated deployment process.

Not much to see here yet, but watch this space.
