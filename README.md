# welcome to emb0x
emb0x is me trying to make a free open source Soundcloud alternative. Just getting started right now.

# run it on your own b0x
this requires docker to be installed first
```
git clone https://github.com/mnori/emb0x.git
cd emb0x
docker-compose up --build
```

you probably need to run dotnet migrations when it's the first time, see the bin folder for hints

or just give me the author (@mnori) a shout, if you have any queries

visit http://localhost:5000/Upload when the docker containers look happy

have fun!
