This is a project where the goal is to build a simple, customisable web based jukebox app. I want something that can be run on a very cheap Amazon set up, with the freedom to run your own independent server running the software. Additionally it ought to be easy for someone to get their own node working without needing to know much about the tech details, i.e. I'd like something with an automated deployment process.

Why? Well I guess I'm a bit tired of Soundcloud's limits on how much content I can host on there, without paying its overpriced fee. Additionally Soundcloud can't be customised to change its appearance etc. vs running something on your own server where you're able to change it into whatever you want.

Not much to see here yet, but watch this space, I am sinking hours into this thing most weekends.
